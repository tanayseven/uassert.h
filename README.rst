Î¼assert.h
=========


Why another assertion library?
------------------------------

The existing assertion library which is already there in C is not very usable for writing tests.
The problem with that is that if there is even a single failure in the tests the execution stops
then and there itself and does not print the other assertion failures. This library will run all
the assertions and show them as failed if they failed else will not print anything if they pass.


How to use?
-----------

Copy and paste the ``uassert.h`` file into your project and build that file along with other files
in your projects which need assertions. The following is a small example of how this file should
be used.


.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "uassert.h"

    int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
    {
        printf("Running tests...\n");
        ASSERT(5 == 4);
        ASSERT(5 == 5);
        ASSERT(5 == 7);
        return TEST_SUCCESS;
    }



Run the above code as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    cc -o ./bin/tests ./test/main.c
    ./bin/tests
    Running tests...
    Assertion failure [5 == 4] on line 7 in file ./test/main.c
    Assertion failure [5 == 7] on line 9 in file ./test/main.c
